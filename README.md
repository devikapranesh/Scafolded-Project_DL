MLP vs CNN on Fashion-MNIST Deep Learning Comparative Study

1.  Problem Statement

This project implements and compares a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the
Fashion-MNIST dataset.

The objective is to: 
- Establish an MLP as a baseline model 
- Improve performance using CNN 
- Analyze feature representation differences 
- Control overfitting 
- Evaluate performance using quantitative and qualitative metrics 
- Build a reproducible deep learning workflow

2.  Dataset

Dataset: Fashion-MNIST Source:
https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Fashion-MNIST consists of:

60,000 training images
10,000 test images
28x28 grayscale images
10 clothing categories

Classes:
T-shirt/top,Trouser,Pullover,Dress,Coat,Sandal,Shirt,Sneaker,Bag,Ankle boot

All images were normalized to the range [0,1].
